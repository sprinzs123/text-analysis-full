Person: Well, one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people.  You cannot be less than frank about the a nature of the crisis.  And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today, Mr. Trump, who is praising China for the good work that they are doing when, in fact, as you indicated, they were lying to their own people and allowing that virus to move much more aggressively than should have been the case. Look, I don't think this is the time for recrimination, to be punishing people.  Now is the time, by the way, to be working with China.  They are learning a lot about this crisis.  And, in fact, they -- you know, we have got to work with them.  We have got to work with the World Health Organization.  We have got to work with Italy.  We have got to work with countries around the world. If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together, got to support each other, this is that moment.
